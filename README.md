# Improving Acne Severity Detection: A GAN Framework with Contour Accentuation for Image Deblurring.
We present an GAN-powered image processing framework for enhancing and transforming digital sketches. Our approach  leverages Contour Accentuation Techniques (CAT) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively enhance and deblur sketch contours, enabling accurate transformations into photo-realistic images.
